        1. Arithmetic Operators  => Addition +, Substraction -, Multiplication *, Division /, Modulus %, Increment ++, Decriment --

        2. Comparison (Relational) Operators => Is equal to ==, Identical (equal and of same data type) ===, Not equal to !=, Not Identical !==, Greater than >,
        Greater equal to >=, Less than <, Less than or equal to <=

        3. Bitwise Operators => Bitwise AND &, Bitwise OR  | , Bitwise XOR ^,
        Bitwise NOT ~, Bitwise Left Shift <<,
        Bitwise Right Shift >>, Bitwise Right Shift with zero >>>

        4. LOgical Operators => Logical AND &&, Logical OR ||, LOgical Not !

        5. Assignment Operators => Asign=, Add And Assign =, subtract and 
        Assign -=, Multiply And Assign *= Divide and Assign /=, Modulus And Assign %=,

        JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.

Operator          Description              Example

+                  Addition                10+20 = 30
-                  Subtraction             20-10 = 10
*                  Multiplication          10*20
/                  Division                20/10 = 2 
%                  Modulus (Remainder)     20%10 = 0
++                 Increment               var a=10; ++a (1+10); a++(10+1); Now a = 11
--                 Decrement               var a=10; -a; a--; Now a = 9
